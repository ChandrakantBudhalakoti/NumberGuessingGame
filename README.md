**Title: Number Guessing Game in Java**

**Project Description:**
The Number Guessing Game is a classic and entertaining Java program that challenges the player's ability to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game offers an interactive and engaging user experience.

**Features and Requirements:**

**Random Number Generation:** The computer should generate a random number within a predefined range. This range can be set at the beginning of the game and should include a minimum and maximum value.

**User Input:** The player should be able to input their guess for the random number. The input should be validated to ensure it's a valid number within the specified range.

**Feedback to the Player:** After each guess, the player should receive feedback on whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct. This feedback should help the player refine their subsequent guesses.

**Guess Counter:** The game should keep track of the number of attempts the player has made to guess the correct number. This counter should be displayed after each guess.

**Winning Condition:** The game should continue until the player correctly guesses the number. Upon a successful guess, the game should display a congratulatory message along with the number of attempts it took to win.

**Play Again Option:** After the game ends, the player should be given the option to play again or exit the game.

**Additional Features (Optional):**

Implement a user-friendly text-based or graphical interface for the game.
Add a difficulty level option, allowing the player to choose a range of numbers for the game (e.g., easy, medium, hard).
Keep track of high scores or the fastest completion times.
**Sample Workflow:**

The game starts by generating a random number within the specified range.
The player is prompted to input their first guess.
After each guess, the game provides feedback and updates the guess counter.
The game continues until the player correctly guesses the random number.
Upon winning, the game displays the number of attempts and offers the option to play again.
This project is an excellent opportunity to apply core Java programming concepts, including conditional statements, loops, user input, and random number generation. It's both fun to implement and play, making it a great choice for learning and practicing Java programming skills.
